### Materials of different learning courses, my solutions, my comments

I tried to put more my solutions here. I study at several courses and I use their (course's) tasks. These courses:
- https://mlcourse.ai/book/index.html, 
- https://github.com/DLSchool,
- https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/info
  
Useful_lib is reference manual for work on different moduls.
